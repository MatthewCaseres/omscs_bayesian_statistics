# Bayesian Computation

Classical statistics is about optimization and bayesian statistics is about integration. When calculating $\pi(\theta|x) = \frac{f(x|\theta)\pi(\theta)}{m(x)}$ the difficult part is the marginal $m(x)$ which is the integral $\int f(x|\theta)\pi(\theta)d\theta$. This integral may be difficult to evaluate so we need to approximate it numerically.

Normalizing ther distribution is easy in conjugate cases but difficult otherwise.

## Laplace's Method

I hope I never have to do this.

## MCMC
